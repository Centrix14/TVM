* And this example will show you the use of several procedures in the program, as well as opportunities .jump + _acc. *

.main
crg _stda 10
prc _stdi 11

crg _stda 11
prc _stdi 10

.jump ~ 1
.jump > _acc 2 * Procedure call 2, as transition conditions, we use the value of the accumulator *
.end

.point 1 * The first procedure *
add _stda 10
subt _stda 11
.goback

.point 2 * The second procedure *
put _cwr 65
.goback
